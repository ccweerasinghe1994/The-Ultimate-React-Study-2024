## 003 How to Split a UI Into Components

![alt text](image-1.png)
The image you've provided illustrates a very important concept in React development: **Component Size Matters**. It highlights the balance developers need to strike between creating components that are either **too small** or **too large**. Both extremes have drawbacks, and the goal is to find a middle ground that allows for reusability, maintainability, and clarity.

Letâ€™s break this concept down in detail and discuss why component size matters and how to approach this issue with examples.

---

### **Why Does Component Size Matter?**

React encourages **component-based architecture**, where you build your UI by combining smaller, reusable pieces (components). However, deciding how big or small a component should be is a crucial part of development. Components that are **too small** or **too big** lead to various problems, as explained in the image.

---

### **Small Components: Pros and Cons**

#### **Pros** of Small Components:
- **Reusability**: Small components are often easier to reuse in different parts of the application.
- **Single Responsibility**: Following the **Single Responsibility Principle** means that small components are focused on doing one thing and doing it well.

#### **Cons** of Small Components:
- **Too Many Components**: If you break everything down into very small pieces, your codebase could end up with **hundreds of tiny components**. This can make the codebase difficult to navigate and maintain.
- **Over-Abstraction**: Sometimes, breaking things down too much can abstract the logic too much, making it hard to understand how different pieces fit together. Each component may hide too many details of the overall implementation.
- **Confusing Codebase**: As the number of components grows, it can be hard for new developers (or even yourself later on) to figure out where certain logic is implemented because itâ€™s spread out across many files and components.

#### **Example of Small Components**

Letâ€™s consider an example where you have a product card that displays an image, title, and price.

##### **Overly Small Components:**
```jsx
const ProductImage = ({ src }) => <img src={src} alt="Product" />;
const ProductTitle = ({ title }) => <h3>{title}</h3>;
const ProductPrice = ({ price }) => <p>{price}</p>;

const ProductCard = ({ product }) => (
  <div>
    <ProductImage src={product.image} />
    <ProductTitle title={product.title} />
    <ProductPrice price={product.price} />
  </div>
);
```

In this example:
- The `ProductImage`, `ProductTitle`, and `ProductPrice` components are too granular.
- While this approach offers flexibility and reusability, it creates a lot of unnecessary small components, which can make the code harder to manage, especially if these components are not reused elsewhere.

---

### **Large Components: Pros and Cons**

#### **Pros** of Large Components:
- **Easier to Understand Locally**: When components are larger, itâ€™s easier to see all related logic in one place.
- **Less Component Overhead**: Fewer components mean less overhead in terms of managing and navigating the component tree, making it easier to trace functionality when debugging.

#### **Cons** of Large Components:
- **Too Many Responsibilities**: Large components often end up violating the **Single Responsibility Principle** because they handle too many concerns at once (e.g., managing state, rendering UI, handling side effects). This makes the component harder to reason about, test, and maintain.
- **Hard to Reuse**: When a component does too many things, it becomes difficult to reuse it in different parts of the application because its logic and structure are tightly coupled.
- **Complex Code**: With large components, the internal logic can become complex and hard to understand. It becomes harder to know what each part of the component does without a lot of investigation.

#### **Example of a Large Component**

Letâ€™s consider a product card again but this time with too much logic inside one component.

##### **Overly Large Component:**
```jsx
const ProductCard = ({ product }) => {
  const addToCart = () => {
    // Add the product to the cart
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <img src={product.image} alt="Product" />
      <h3>{product.title}</h3>
      <p>{product.price}</p>
      <button onClick={addToCart}>Add to Cart</button>
    </div>
  );
};
```

In this example:
- The `ProductCard` handles both the rendering of the product details and the logic for adding the product to the cart.
- This tightly couples the rendering logic with the functionality of adding to the cart, making it harder to reuse this component if the cart functionality changes or moves elsewhere.

---

### **Finding the Right Balance: The Middle Ground**

The key takeaway from the image is that **we need to find the right balance** between breaking components down into many small pieces and grouping too many responsibilities in one large component.

#### **The Ideal Component Size**

A good rule of thumb is that a component should:
- **Handle one responsibility** or a **cohesive part of the UI**.
- Be **easy to reuse** but not overly abstracted.
- Be **easy to test** in isolation.
- Be **easy to maintain**, with clear boundaries between concerns.

#### **Balanced Example: Product Card**

Hereâ€™s a more balanced approach to creating the `ProductCard` component:

```jsx
const ProductDetails = ({ product }) => (
  <div>
    <img src={product.image} alt={product.title} />
    <h3>{product.title}</h3>
    <p>{product.price}</p>
  </div>
);

const AddToCartButton = ({ onAdd }) => (
  <button onClick={onAdd}>Add to Cart</button>
);

const ProductCard = ({ product, onAddToCart }) => (
  <div>
    <ProductDetails product={product} />
    <AddToCartButton onAdd={() => onAddToCart(product)} />
  </div>
);
```

- The `ProductDetails` component is responsible for rendering the product information.
- The `AddToCartButton` is a reusable button that handles the "add to cart" action.
- The `ProductCard` component brings them together but delegates the specific responsibilities to smaller, more focused components.

This approach keeps components **small enough to be reusable** but **large enough to handle a meaningful part of the UI** without splitting it into too many trivial pieces.

---

### **Guidelines for Deciding Component Size**

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**:
   - Each component should handle one responsibility. If you notice a component doing too many things (e.g., managing state, handling side effects, rendering UI), consider breaking it down into smaller components.

2. **Reusability**:
   - If a part of your component can be reused in multiple places, consider making it a separate component. However, avoid breaking things down into overly granular components if they are unlikely to be reused.

3. **Component Composition**:
   - Think in terms of **component composition**: larger components should be composed of smaller components that handle distinct pieces of the logic/UI. This allows for better readability, maintainability, and testability.

4. **Prop Drilling**:
   - If you find yourself passing too many props through several components, it may be a sign that a component is taking on too many responsibilities or is not positioned correctly in the component hierarchy.

---

### **Conclusion: Finding the Sweet Spot**

Thereâ€™s no strict rule for how big or small a component should be, but finding the **right balance** is crucial for creating maintainable and scalable applications. 

- **Too many small components** can lead to a fragmented and confusing codebase with too much abstraction.
- **Too large components** can become hard to maintain, understand, and reuse.

Aim for a middle ground where each component has a clear responsibility, is easy to understand, and can be reused where appropriate. By following this approach, you can build more maintainable and scalable React applications.
![alt text](image-2.png)
The image you've provided outlines the key principles for **splitting a user interface (UI) into components** in React. These guidelines are essential for maintaining a clean, reusable, and easy-to-understand codebase. Letâ€™s go through these criteria in depth with examples to illustrate how you should think about breaking down a UI into components.

---

### **The 4 Criteria for Splitting a UI into Components**

1. **Logical Separation of Content/Layout**
2. **Reusability**
3. **Responsibilities/Complexity**
4. **Personal Coding Style**

Let's break down each criterion and understand how to apply it effectively.

---

### **1. Logical Separation of Content/Layout**

The first criterion is ensuring that your components have a **logical separation** between content and layout. This means that each component should represent a distinct part of the UI and handle one specific task or layout element.

#### **Example: Product Listing Component**

Imagine you have a product listing with the following structure:

- Image of the product
- Product title
- Product description
- Price and availability
- Buttons like "Add to Cart" or "Wishlist"

You could structure this as one large component, but that wouldnâ€™t have a logical separation of content. Instead, you could split it up like this:

#### **Before: A Single Component**

```jsx
const ProductCard = ({ product }) => (
  <div>
    <img src={product.image} alt={product.title} />
    <h3>{product.title}</h3>
    <p>{product.description}</p>
    <p>{product.price}</p>
    <button>Add to Cart</button>
    <button>Wishlist</button>
  </div>
);
```

This component is doing **too much**. It handles the image, text, and buttons in a single place, which is harder to maintain and reuse.

#### **After: Logical Separation of Content**

```jsx
const ProductImage = ({ image, title }) => <img src={image} alt={title} />;
const ProductDetails = ({ title, description, price }) => (
  <div>
    <h3>{title}</h3>
    <p>{description}</p>
    <p>{price}</p>
  </div>
);
const ProductActions = () => (
  <div>
    <button>Add to Cart</button>
    <button>Wishlist</button>
  </div>
);
const ProductCard = ({ product }) => (
  <div>
    <ProductImage image={product.image} title={product.title} />
    <ProductDetails title={product.title} description={product.description} price={product.price} />
    <ProductActions />
  </div>
);
```

By splitting the content into distinct parts (`ProductImage`, `ProductDetails`, `ProductActions`), you achieve **logical separation**, making it easier to maintain and reuse individual components.

---

### **2. Reusability**

The second criterion is **reusability**. When building components, think about whether they can be reused in different parts of the application. A reusable component is generic and flexible enough to be used in multiple places without needing to modify the core logic.

#### **Example: Reusable Buttons**

In your application, you may have buttons for various actions like "Add to Cart," "Submit," or "Save." Rather than hardcoding these buttons in each place, you can create a **reusable Button component**.

#### **Before: Hardcoded Buttons**

```jsx
const ProductCard = () => (
  <div>
    <button>Add to Cart</button>
    <button>Wishlist</button>
  </div>
);
```

This is not reusable because the button text and behavior are hardcoded.

#### **After: Reusable Button Component**

```jsx
const Button = ({ label, onClick }) => (
  <button onClick={onClick}>{label}</button>
);
const ProductActions = () => (
  <div>
    <Button label="Add to Cart" onClick={() => console.log('Added to cart')} />
    <Button label="Wishlist" onClick={() => console.log('Added to wishlist')} />
  </div>
);
```

Now, the `Button` component can be reused for different actions throughout your app by simply passing different `label` and `onClick` props.

---

### **3. Responsibilities / Complexity**

The third criterion focuses on reducing complexity and ensuring that components follow the **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**. A component should have **one responsibility** and do that well. This makes components easier to test, debug, and maintain.

#### **Example: Handling Both State and UI in One Component**

Letâ€™s consider a form component that is responsible for both rendering the form UI and managing form state.

#### **Before: A Component with Too Many Responsibilities**

```jsx
const Form = () => {
  const [name, setName] = useState('');
  const handleSubmit = () => {
    console.log('Form submitted:', name);
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <input value={name} onChange={e => setName(e.target.value)} />
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  );
};
```

Here, the `Form` component is managing state and rendering the form UI, which makes it harder to maintain and reuse.

#### **After: Separating Logic and UI**

```jsx
const useForm = () => {
  const [name, setName] = useState('');
  const handleSubmit = () => {
    console.log('Form submitted:', name);
  };
  return { name, setName, handleSubmit };
};

const Form = ({ name, setName, handleSubmit }) => (
  <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
    <input value={name} onChange={e => setName(e.target.value)} />
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
  </form>
);

const App = () => {
  const { name, setName, handleSubmit } = useForm();
  return <Form name={name} setName={setName} handleSubmit={handleSubmit} />;
};
```

By splitting the form logic into the `useForm` custom hook, the `Form` component becomes responsible only for rendering the UI, while the `useForm` hook handles the state and logic.

---

### **4. Personal Coding Style**

While the first three criteria are more objective, **personal coding style** plays a role in how you break down components. Different developers have different approaches based on their preferences, team conventions, or specific project requirements.

#### **Example: Breaking Down Layout Components**

Some developers may prefer to create layout components for things like rows, columns, or containers.

#### **Row and Column Components**

```jsx
const Row = ({ children }) => <div style={{ display: 'flex' }}>{children}</div>;
const Column = ({ children }) => <div style={{ flex: 1 }}>{children}</div>;

const LayoutExample = () => (
  <Row>
    <Column>Left Content</Column>
    <Column>Right Content</Column>
  </Row>
);
```

Other developers might prefer to use simpler HTML structures without abstracting them into layout components. In this case, personal coding style dictates how granular you get with component creation.

---

### **Conclusion: How to Split UI into Components**

In React development, splitting the UI into components is not just about breaking things down but doing so thoughtfully and strategically. Following these four criteria helps you avoid common pitfalls and create a scalable, maintainable application:

1. **Logical Separation of Content/Layout**: Break components down based on their role in the UI, separating concerns like layout and content.
2. **Reusability**: Look for opportunities to make components generic and reusable across different parts of the app.
3. **Responsibilities/Complexity**: Ensure each component follows the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) and isnâ€™t overloaded with too much logic or too many concerns.
4. **Personal Coding Style**: Consider your own preferences and team conventions when deciding how granular or abstract your components should be.

By keeping these principles in mind, you can build a well-structured React app that is easy to maintain, extend, and scale.

![alt text](image-4.png)

Let's go through each of the general guidelines presented in the image, breaking them down with examples to illustrate their importance in React development:

### 1. **Creating a New Component Creates a New Abstraction**

- **Explanation**: When you create a new component, you are introducing a new level of abstraction in your code. Abstractions are useful, but they come at a cost: switching back and forth between too many components can increase the complexity of understanding the app.
- **Mental Cost**: More components mean more mental energy required to keep track of what each component does and how they interact with each other. 
- **Best Practice**: Donâ€™t create new components too early in the development process. Only introduce a new component when thereâ€™s a clear need for it (e.g., when you want to reuse it in multiple places, or to improve readability by separating concerns).

#### **Example**:

- **Too Many Components Too Early**:
  ```jsx
  const Title = ({ text }) => <h1>{text}</h1>;
  const Description = ({ text }) => <p>{text}</p>;

  const ProductCard = ({ product }) => (
    <div>
      <Title text={product.title} />
      <Description text={product.description} />
    </div>
  );
  ```

  Here, `Title` and `Description` might be overkill if theyâ€™re only used in this `ProductCard` and donâ€™t add significant complexity to the component. Creating them adds unnecessary abstraction.

- **Simpler Approach**:
  ```jsx
  const ProductCard = ({ product }) => (
    <div>
      <h1>{product.title}</h1>
      <p>{product.description}</p>
    </div>
  );
  ```

  By keeping everything in one component, you reduce abstraction and make the code easier to follow.

---

### 2. **Name a Component According to What It Does or Displays**

- **Explanation**: Naming is crucial to making your code easy to understand. Components should have clear, descriptive names that indicate what they do or display. Donâ€™t hesitate to use longer names if it improves clarity.
- **Avoid Short or Vague Names**: Using names like `Box` or `Wrapper` doesnâ€™t provide enough information about what the component actually does.
- **Best Practice**: Give components names like `ProductCard`, `UserProfile`, or `NavigationBar`, which clearly describe the purpose of the component.

#### **Example**:

- **Poor Naming**:
  ```jsx
  const Box = ({ children }) => <div>{children}</div>;
  ```

  The name `Box` is too generic and doesnâ€™t tell us much about what the component does.

- **Better Naming**:
  ```jsx
  const ProductCard = ({ product }) => (
    <div>
      <h1>{product.title}</h1>
      <p>{product.description}</p>
    </div>
  );
  ```

  `ProductCard` is much clearer. It tells us this component is responsible for displaying product information.

---

### 3. **Never Declare a New Component Inside Another Component**

- **Explanation**: Declaring components inside other components causes React to recreate the component on every render, which can lead to performance issues and unnecessary re-renders.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Components should have their own scope and should not be declared inside other components to maintain clear boundaries.
- **Best Practice**: Always declare components outside of other components.

#### **Example**:

- **Incorrect**:
  ```jsx
  const ParentComponent = () => {
    const ChildComponent = () => <div>Child</div>;
    return <ChildComponent />;
  };
  ```

  In this example, `ChildComponent` is recreated every time `ParentComponent` renders, which can degrade performance.

- **Correct**:
  ```jsx
  const ChildComponent = () => <div>Child</div>;

  const ParentComponent = () => <ChildComponent />;
  ```

  By moving `ChildComponent` outside, we prevent it from being recreated unnecessarily.

---

### 4. **Co-locate Related Components Inside the Same File**

- **Explanation**: Components that are closely related (e.g., a `ProductImage` component and a `ProductDetails` component used inside a `ProductCard`) can be kept in the same file. This practice makes the code easier to follow and maintain.
- **Donâ€™t Separate Too Early**: Donâ€™t split components into different files prematurely. Itâ€™s okay to colocate components until the code becomes too large or too complex.
- **Best Practice**: Co-locate related components, especially if they will only be used together. Later, you can move them to separate files if needed.

#### **Example**:

- **Co-locating Components**:
  ```jsx
  // ProductCard.js
  const ProductImage = ({ image }) => <img src={image} alt="Product" />;
  const ProductDetails = ({ title, description }) => (
    <div>
      <h1>{title}</h1>
      <p>{description}</p>
    </div>
  );

  const ProductCard = ({ product }) => (
    <div>
      <ProductImage image={product.image} />
      <ProductDetails title={product.title} description={product.description} />
    </div>
  );
  ```

  In this example, the related components (`ProductImage`, `ProductDetails`, and `ProductCard`) are kept in the same file because they belong to the same logical grouping. Only move them to separate files if they grow in complexity or are used in other parts of the app.

---

### 5. **Itâ€™s Normal for an App to Have Components of Different Sizes**

- **Explanation**: Not all components need to be the same size. Some components will be small and focused (like a `Button`), while others might be larger and more complex (like a `Dashboard` component). This variation is normal and expected.
- **Small vs. Large Components**: Small components handle specific tasks, while larger components might manage more complex layouts or combine multiple smaller components.
- **Best Practice**: Donâ€™t worry if some components are large as long as they are managing complexity appropriately. If a component becomes too large, look for ways to refactor it into smaller pieces.

#### **Example**:

- **Small Component**:
  ```jsx
  const Button = ({ label, onClick }) => (
    <button onClick={onClick}>{label}</button>
  );
  ```

  This is a small, focused component that handles a specific task (rendering a button).

- **Larger Component**:
  ```jsx
  const Dashboard = ({ user, stats }) => (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome, {user.name}</h1>
      <Stats stats={stats} />
      <RecentActivity activities={user.activities} />
    </div>
  );
  ```

  The `Dashboard` component is larger because it combines multiple smaller components (`Stats`, `RecentActivity`) to display a complex UI. This is perfectly fine as long as itâ€™s managing the complexity appropriately.

---

### **Conclusion**

These guidelines are key to building maintainable, scalable React applications:

1. **New abstractions** (new components) should be created only when necessary to avoid over-complicating the app.
2. **Component names** should be descriptive of what the component does or displays.
3. **Components should not be declared inside other components** to avoid performance issues and maintain separation of concerns.
4. **Related components should be co-located** until complexity warrants separation.
5. **Itâ€™s natural for some components to be small and others to be large**â€”donâ€™t feel like all components need to be the same size.

By following these guidelines, your components will be easier to understand, maintain, and scale in a React application.

## 005 Component Categories
![alt text](image-6.png)
The image youâ€™ve shared highlights three main categories of React components: **Stateless/Presentational components**, **Stateful components**, and **Structural components**. Letâ€™s go through each category in depth with examples to understand how to categorize your components and when to use each type.

---

### **1. Stateless/Presentational Components**

- **Description**: These components do not manage any state internally. They are "dumb" components that receive **props** and simply **display content** or render UI based on those props. They are often small, focused, and reusable because they handle only presentation logic and not business logic.

- **Key Characteristics**:
  - **No internal state**: They donâ€™t manage state themselves. All data comes through props.
  - **Reusability**: They are often small and easy to reuse in different parts of the application.
  - **Focus on presentation**: Their only job is to display something based on the data provided.

#### **Example**:

Letâ€™s say you have a movie app where you need to display a list of movies.

```tsx
const Movie = ({ title, year }) => (
  <div>
    <h2>{title}</h2>
    <p>{year}</p>
  </div>
);

const MovieList = ({ movies }) => (
  <div>
    {movies.map(movie => (
      <Movie key={movie.id} title={movie.title} year={movie.year} />
    ))}
  </div>
);
```

In this example:
- The `Movie` component is stateless. It simply displays the title and year of a movie, and it does not manage any internal state.
- The `MovieList` component is also stateless. It just loops through an array of movies and renders the `Movie` component for each one.

#### **Advantages**:
- **Reusable**: These components are often highly reusable in different parts of your application.
- **Easy to test**: Since they donâ€™t have internal logic or state, they are easy to test.
- **Separation of concerns**: They handle only UI rendering, keeping the logic separate from the view.

---

### **2. Stateful Components**

- **Description**: These components manage **internal state**. They usually contain business logic or state management logic that affects what is rendered. While they can still be reusable, their role is to manage dynamic data or interactions, such as form inputs, toggles, and filtering.

- **Key Characteristics**:
  - **Have state**: They use Reactâ€™s `useState` (or other hooks) to manage state.
  - **Can still be reusable**: Though they manage state, they can still be reused if they are designed generically.
  - **Interactive**: Often used for handling user interactions or data updates.

#### **Example**:

Letâ€™s say you want a search bar that allows users to filter a list of movies.

```tsx
const SearchBar = ({ onSearch }) => {
  const [query, setQuery] = useState("");

  const handleChange = (e) => {
    setQuery(e.target.value);
    onSearch(e.target.value);
  };

  return (
    <input
      type="text"
      value={query}
      onChange={handleChange}
      placeholder="Search movies..."
    />
  );
};
```

In this example:
- `SearchBar` is a **stateful component** because it manages the `query` state, which represents the userâ€™s input.
- As the user types, the state (`query`) is updated and passed back to the parent through the `onSearch` prop.

#### **Advantages**:
- **Handles user input**: Ideal for components that manage user input or need to respond to changes.
- **Manages internal logic**: Great for handling dynamic data and updating the UI based on the state.
- **Still reusable**: If designed carefully, stateful components can still be reusable, for instance, by passing the state-modifying function (`onSearch`) as props to make them flexible.

---

### **3. Structural Components**

- **Description**: These components represent **larger, structural pieces of your application**, such as pages, layouts, or entire screens. They often **compose multiple smaller components** together. While they can be reusable (e.g., layouts), they are sometimes more specific and **non-reusable**. For example, a component that handles the entire layout of a dashboard might not be reused elsewhere.

- **Key Characteristics**:
  - **Composed of other components**: They combine presentational and stateful components to form larger sections or pages.
  - **Can be large and non-reusable**: Some of these components may be highly specific to a single part of your app, like a homepage layout or a dashboard.
  - **Define application structure**: They help organize the overall layout and flow of the application.

#### **Example**:

Consider a movie app where you display both a list of movies and a section showing movies the user has watched.

```tsx
const MainPage = () => (
  <div>
    <SearchBar />
    <MovieList movies={movies} />
    <WatchedMovies watchedMovies={watchedMovies} />
  </div>
);
```

In this example:
- `MainPage` is a **structural component** that combines smaller presentational and stateful components (`SearchBar`, `MovieList`, and `WatchedMovies`).
- It handles the overall layout of the page but doesnâ€™t handle much logic itself, delegating that to its child components.

#### **Advantages**:
- **Composition**: These components help bring together multiple smaller components, maintaining the structure of the page.
- **Keeps the app organized**: Larger apps need structural components to divide the app into manageable sections or pages.
- **Clear separation of concerns**: Structural components keep the logic and presentation separate by delegating tasks to smaller components.

---

### **Summary of Categories**:

1. **Stateless/Presentational Components**:
   - No state, receives data via props, focused on rendering UI.
   - Small, reusable, and easy to test.
   
2. **Stateful Components**:
   - Manage internal state, can be reusable but more focused on interactions or data updates.
   - Handle user input or dynamic data.

3. **Structural Components**:
   - Larger components that structure the layout or pages of the app.
   - Composed of other components and can be non-reusable but provide important structure to the app.

---

By understanding these three categories, you can better organize your React code and build more maintainable applications. Use **stateless components** for simple UI rendering, **stateful components** for managing data and interactions, and **structural components** for defining the overall layout and structure of your app.
## 006 Prop Drilling

**Prop Drilling** is a term commonly used in React (and other component-based UI libraries) to describe the process of passing data from a parent component down to child components through props, especially when the data is needed by a deeply nested child component. This often involves passing the data through intermediate components that do not need or use it, solely to get it to the component that does.

While prop drilling is a straightforward way to pass data, it can lead to code that is hard to read, maintain, and scale, especially in large applications with deeply nested component trees.

In this comprehensive explanation, we'll delve into:

1. What prop drilling is.
2. Why it can be problematic.
3. Practical examples illustrating prop drilling.
4. Solutions to avoid prop drilling.

---

## **1. Understanding Prop Drilling**

At its core, prop drilling is about passing props through multiple layers of components to reach a specific child component. This happens when data held at a higher level in the component hierarchy is needed by components several levels deep.

### **Simplified Example**

Consider a simple component hierarchy:

- `App`
  - `Parent`
    - `Child`
      - `Grandchild`

Suppose `App` holds some data or state that `Grandchild` needs. With prop drilling, `App` would pass the data to `Parent`, which would pass it to `Child`, which would then pass it to `Grandchild`.

**Visualization:**

```
App (data) --> Parent (data) --> Child (data) --> Grandchild (uses data)
```

**Key Points:**

- **Intermediate Components:** `Parent` and `Child` receive `data` via props but may not use it.
- **Redundancy:** Passing props through components that don't need them introduces unnecessary code.
- **Maintenance Challenges:** Adding, removing, or reordering components requires updating prop passing.

---

## **2. Why Prop Drilling Can Be Problematic**

While prop drilling works for small applications or shallow component trees, it introduces several issues in more complex scenarios.

### **Issues with Prop Drilling**

1. **Boilerplate Code:**

   - **Repetition:** Repeatedly passing props through multiple layers leads to repetitive code.
   - **Verbosity:** The codebase becomes verbose, making it harder to read and understand.

2. **Tight Coupling:**

   - **Component Dependence:** Intermediate components become tightly coupled with data they don't use.
   - **Reusability Reduction:** Components are less reusable because they rely on specific props.

3. **Maintenance Overhead:**

   - **Fragility:** Changing the component hierarchy requires updating all the prop passing.
   - **Error-Prone:** Increased likelihood of bugs due to missed or incorrectly passed props.

4. **Reduced Readability:**

   - **Complexity:** It's harder to trace where data is coming from and how it's being used.
   - **Cognitive Load:** Developers need to keep track of props across multiple components.

---

## **3. Practical Examples Illustrating Prop Drilling**

Let's explore a more detailed example to see prop drilling in action.

### **Example Scenario**

Imagine a React application where we want to display a user's name in a deeply nested component. The component hierarchy is as follows:

- `App` (holds user data)
  - `Dashboard`
    - `Sidebar`
      - `UserMenu` (needs user data)
    - `Content`
      - `Feed`

### **Implementing Prop Drilling**

#### **1. `App` Component**

```jsx
// App.js
import React from 'react';
import Dashboard from './Dashboard';

function App() {
  const user = { name: 'Alice', id: 1 };

  return <Dashboard user={user} />;
}

export default App;
```

#### **2. `Dashboard` Component**

```jsx
// Dashboard.js
import React from 'react';
import Sidebar from './Sidebar';
import Content from './Content';

function Dashboard({ user }) {
  return (
    <div className="dashboard">
      <Sidebar user={user} />
      <Content />
    </div>
  );
}

export default Dashboard;
```

#### **3. `Sidebar` Component**

```jsx
// Sidebar.js
import React from 'react';
import UserMenu from './UserMenu';

function Sidebar({ user }) {
  return (
    <div className="sidebar">
      <UserMenu user={user} />
    </div>
  );
}

export default Sidebar;
```

#### **4. `UserMenu` Component**

```jsx
// UserMenu.js
import React from 'react';

function UserMenu({ user }) {
  return (
    <div className="user-menu">
      <p>Welcome, {user.name}!</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default UserMenu;
```

#### **Issues Highlighted**

- **Unnecessary Prop Passing:** `Dashboard` and `Sidebar` pass down `user` but don't use it.
- **Scaling Problems:** If more components need `user`, we need to pass it through more props.
- **Maintenance Burden:** Changing the structure (e.g., inserting a new component) requires updating the props.

---

## **4. Solutions to Avoid Prop Drilling**

To mitigate the drawbacks of prop drilling, we can use several strategies:

1. **React Context API**
2. **State Management Libraries (e.g., Redux)**
3. **Render Props and Higher-Order Components (HOCs)**
4. **Composition Patterns**

### **1. Using the React Context API**

The React Context API provides a way to share values between components without explicitly passing props through every level.

#### **Steps to Use Context API**

1. **Create a Context:**

   ```jsx
   // UserContext.js
   import React from 'react';

   const UserContext = React.createContext();

   export default UserContext;
   ```

2. **Provide the Context Value:**

   ```jsx
   // App.js
   import React from 'react';
   import Dashboard from './Dashboard';
   import UserContext from './UserContext';

   function App() {
     const user = { name: 'Alice', id: 1 };

     return (
       <UserContext.Provider value={user}>
         <Dashboard />
       </UserContext.Provider>
     );
   }

   export default App;
   ```

3. **Consume the Context Value:**

   ```jsx
   // UserMenu.js
   import React, { useContext } from 'react';
   import UserContext from './UserContext';

   function UserMenu() {
     const user = useContext(UserContext);

     return (
       <div className="user-menu">
         <p>Welcome, {user.name}!</p>
       </div>
     );
   }

   export default UserMenu;
   ```

#### **Advantages**

- **Eliminates Prop Drilling:** Intermediate components no longer need to pass down props they don't use.
- **Improves Readability:** Components consume only the data they need.
- **Enhances Maintainability:** Changes to the component tree don't require updating prop passing.

#### **Updated Component Hierarchy**

- `App` (provides user data via `UserContext`)
  - `Dashboard`
    - `Sidebar`
      - `UserMenu` (consumes user data from `UserContext`)

#### **Visualization:**

```
App (UserContext Provider)
|
--> Dashboard
     |
     --> Sidebar
          |
          --> UserMenu (consumes user data via useContext)
```

### **2. Using State Management Libraries**

Libraries like **Redux** or **MobX** provide a global state that can be accessed by any component.

#### **Pros:**

- **Centralized State:** All application state is in one place.
- **Predictability:** State changes are predictable and traceable.

#### **Cons:**

- **Complexity:** Adds additional layers of abstraction.
- **Boilerplate:** Requires more setup and code.

### **3. Render Props and Higher-Order Components (HOCs)**

These patterns allow components to share logic and data without prop drilling.

#### **Render Props Example**

```jsx
// DataProvider.js
function DataProvider({ render }) {
  const data = { /* some data */ };
  return render(data);
}

// Usage
<DataProvider render={(data) => <ChildComponent data={data} />} />
```

#### **HOC Example**

```jsx
function withUser(Component) {
  return function WrappedComponent(props) {
    const user = /* get user data */;
    return <Component {...props} user={user} />;
  };
}

// Usage
const UserMenuWithUser = withUser(UserMenu);
```

### **4. Composition Patterns**

Use composition to pass components as children or props, reducing the need to pass down data explicitly.

#### **Example**

```jsx
// Instead of passing data, pass components
function Sidebar({ userMenu }) {
  return (
    <div className="sidebar">
      {userMenu}
    </div>
  );
}

// Usage
<Sidebar userMenu={<UserMenu />} />
```

---

## **Conclusion**

Prop drilling is a common pattern that can lead to issues in larger applications. By understanding its drawbacks and employing strategies like the React Context API or state management libraries, you can write cleaner, more maintainable, and scalable code.

**Key Takeaways:**

- **Assess the Need:** Prop drilling is acceptable for small, simple cases.
- **Use Context Wisely:** Context API is powerful but should be used judiciously to avoid over-complicating the app.
- **Optimize for Readability:** Always aim for code that's easy to read and maintain.

---

**Final Thoughts:**

Understanding prop drilling and its alternatives is crucial for building robust React applications. By thoughtfully managing how data flows through your components, you can create applications that are not only functional but also easy to work with and extend.

## 007 Component Composition
![alt text](image-7.png)
This image illustrates the concept of **Component Composition** in React, which is a key pattern used to build reusable components. Component Composition allows us to combine multiple components together in a flexible way, rather than hard-coding components inside one another.

### Left Side (Using a Component - **Not Reusable**)

In the left-side example:
- A `Modal` component is defined, and it directly renders a `Success` component inside it.
- This creates a **tight coupling** between `Modal` and `Success`. In this case, `Success` is **hardcoded** inside `Modal`, meaning that every time `Modal` is used, it will always display the `Success` component. This limits the flexibility and reusability of the `Modal` component, as you cannot use `Modal` to display anything else.
- **Problem:** If you wanted to use `Modal` to display different types of content (for example, an error message or any other component), you would need to modify the `Modal` component itself each time.

### Example of this approach:

```jsx
function Modal() {
  return (
    <div className="modal">
      <Success />
    </div>
  );
}

function Success() {
  return <p>Well done!</p>;
}
```

In this approach:
- Every time the `Modal` component is used, it will always display the `Success` message.
- **No Reusability:** You cannot easily reuse the `Modal` component to display different content.

### Right Side (Using **Component Composition** - **Reusable**)

In the right-side example:
- The `Modal` component is designed to accept **children** props. This allows you to pass any component as the content of `Modal`, making `Modal` more **flexible** and **reusable**.
- The `Modal` no longer directly renders a specific component (like `Success`), but instead uses `{children}`, allowing different components to be passed inside it.

### Example of this approach (Component Composition):

```jsx
function Modal({ children }) {
  return (
    <div className="modal">
      {children}
    </div>
  );
}

function Success() {
  return <p>Well done!</p>;
}

function Error() {
  return <p>This went wrong!</p>;
}
```

Now, `Modal` can be used to display any content passed as `children`. For example:

```jsx
// Use Modal to display Success
<Modal>
  <Success />
</Modal>

// Use Modal to display Error
<Modal>
  <Error />
</Modal>
```

### **Benefits of Component Composition**:

1. **Reusability**: 
   - The `Modal` component can now be reused for different types of content, not just for displaying `Success`. This reduces the need to duplicate similar code or create different versions of `Modal`.

2. **Flexibility**: 
   - You can use the `Modal` component to display a wide variety of content by passing different components as its children. For example, you can pass in forms, text, error messages, images, etc.

3. **Separation of Concerns**:
   - The `Modal` component doesnâ€™t need to know what itâ€™s displayingâ€”it only handles the layout (modal styling), while the content is passed from outside. This separation makes it easier to manage and maintain the components.

---

### **Key Concepts:**

1. **Children Prop:**
   - In React, the `children` prop is a special prop that allows developers to pass JSX elements or components between the opening and closing tags of a component. In the case of `Modal`, `{children}` acts as a placeholder for whatever is passed between `<Modal>` and `</Modal>` tags.

2. **Component Composition Pattern:**
   - Composition is one of Reactâ€™s most powerful features. It allows us to combine different components together, passing them as children or as props, rather than hardcoding dependencies. This creates more scalable and modular applications.

---

### **Conclusion:**
The example on the right side shows a better design practice through **Component Composition**, which maximizes reusability and flexibility. You can reuse the `Modal` component to show a wide range of content (success, error, or anything else) by passing different components as children. This pattern is fundamental when building scalable React applications.

![alt text](image-8.png)

The image demonstrates the **Component Composition** pattern in React, with a focus on using the `children` prop to create more flexible and reusable components. Letâ€™s dive into this concept and why it is crucial for building scalable and maintainable applications.

### **What is Component Composition?**
Component composition in React refers to combining components in such a way that one component can act as a container for other components, typically through the `children` prop. This allows the parent component to display any arbitrary content, without needing to know the specifics of that content ahead of time.

This technique is used to create highly reusable components. Instead of hard-coding components inside a parent, composition allows you to pass children or other components as props, which is a powerful way to build flexible UIs.

---

### **Understanding the Example in the Image**

On the left side of the image, the code snippet shows how to pass different components (like `Success` and `Error`) into a `Modal` component using the `children` prop. This approach allows for **component reuse** and keeps the code modular.

#### **The `Modal` Component**

```jsx
function Modal({ children }) {
  return (
    <div className="modal">
      {children}
    </div>
  );
}
```

- The `Modal` component receives a `children` prop, which represents any content passed between its opening and closing tags.
- `{children}` acts as a placeholder for whatever content is passed to the `Modal` component.
- This makes `Modal` independent of the specific content it displays, increasing its reusability.

#### **The `Error` Component**

```jsx
function Error() {
  return <p>This went wrong!</p>;
}
```

- The `Error` component is a simple component that returns an error message.
- Similarly, you might have a `Success` component that returns a success message, like so:

```jsx
function Success() {
  return <p>Well done!</p>;
}
```

### **Using Component Composition**

Hereâ€™s how you can use the `Modal` component with either the `Success` or `Error` components as its children:

```jsx
// Use Modal with Success component as child
<Modal>
  <Success />
</Modal>

// Use Modal with Error component as child
<Modal>
  <Error />
</Modal>
```

### **Key Points:**

1. **The Modal component is reusable**: 
   - `Modal` does not need to know whether it will display a success message or an error message. It simply renders whatever content is passed to it via the `children` prop.
   
2. **Component flexibility**: 
   - The `Modal` component can handle any content, not just predefined components like `Success` or `Error`. This could be a form, an image, or any other JSX element.

3. **Loose coupling**: 
   - The `Modal` component is **loosely coupled** to its children, which means it is not dependent on any specific content. This is a key principle in software development because it allows components to be reused in different contexts without modification.

---

### **Advantages of Component Composition**

1. **Reusable and Flexible Components**:
   - By using the `children` prop, the `Modal` component can be reused across the application for various purposes (showing different messages, forms, etc.) without any changes to its internal implementation. This increases code modularity.

2. **Avoiding Prop Drilling**:
   - Component composition helps to avoid prop drilling, where props need to be passed through several layers of components that donâ€™t need them. Instead, you can pass the necessary content directly into a component via its `children`, making it much more efficient, especially in layouts and UIs that require dynamic content.

3. **Separation of Concerns**:
   - The `Modal` component is only concerned with the layout or structure (such as how the modal looks), while the content (such as success or error messages) is passed in from outside. This separation makes it easier to maintain both the layout and the content independently.

---

### **A Real-World Example**

Imagine you have a web application where you need to display modals for various purposes: confirmation dialogs, error messages, success notifications, and even forms.

With component composition, you can use the same `Modal` component to handle all these cases, simply by passing different content to it.

#### **Confirmation Modal Example:**

```jsx
<Modal>
  <p>Are you sure you want to delete this item?</p>
  <button>Confirm</button>
  <button>Cancel</button>
</Modal>
```

#### **Form in Modal Example:**

```jsx
<Modal>
  <form>
    <label>Name:</label>
    <input type="text" />
    <button>Submit</button>
  </form>
</Modal>
```

In both cases, the `Modal` component remains unchanged, but the content passed as `children` is different, showcasing its flexibility.

---

### **Conclusion**

Component Composition, especially when using the `children` prop, is a powerful tool in React that allows developers to create flexible, reusable components. The `Modal` component in the examples doesnâ€™t need to know about its children in advance, making it capable of displaying any type of content.

This approach reduces coupling between components, prevents unnecessary prop drilling, and makes the codebase easier to maintain and extend. It is a fundamental pattern in React and essential for building scalable UIs.

If you continue to apply composition patterns in your React applications, youâ€™ll find your components become easier to manage, test, and reuse across different parts of your app.


## 008 Fixing Prop Drilling With Composition (And Building a Layout)

```tsx

export default function App() {
    const [movies, setMovies] = useState<TTempMovieData[]>(tempMovieData);

    return (
        <>
            <NavBar>
                <SearchBar/>
                <NumResults movies={movies}/>
            </NavBar>
            <Main>
                <ListBox>
                    <MovieList movies={movies}/>
                </ListBox>
            </Main>
        </>
    );
}
```
## Introduction

In React development, **prop drilling** is a common issue that arises when you need to pass data from a parent component to deeply nested child components. This involves passing props through multiple intermediate components that do not necessarily need the data themselves. While prop drilling is a straightforward way to pass data, it can lead to cluttered code and make components less reusable and harder to maintain.

One effective way to address prop drilling is through **composition**, a design principle that allows you to build complex UIs by combining simpler components. By leveraging composition, you can create a more maintainable and scalable codebase.

In this article, we'll dive deep into how to fix prop drilling using composition while building a layout. We'll explore practical examples to illustrate how composition can simplify your React applications.

---

## What is Prop Drilling?

Prop drilling occurs when you pass data through several nested components to reach the component that actually needs it. This can make your codebase:

- **Difficult to maintain**: Intermediate components become cluttered with props they don't use.
- **Less reusable**: Components become tightly coupled to specific data shapes.
- **Hard to read**: The flow of data becomes obscured, making it difficult for developers to understand how data moves through the application.

**Example of Prop Drilling:**

```jsx
// App.js
function App() {
  const user = { name: 'Alice', age: 30 };

  return <Parent user={user} />;
}

// Parent.js
function Parent({ user }) {
  return <Child user={user} />;
}

// Child.js
function Child({ user }) {
  return <GrandChild user={user} />;
}

// GrandChild.js
function GrandChild({ user }) {
  return <div>{user.name}</div>;
}
```

In this example, the `user` prop is passed through `Parent` and `Child` components that don't use it, just to get it to `GrandChild`.

---

## Understanding Composition in React

**Composition** is a fundamental concept in React that allows you to build components by combining simpler ones. Instead of inheritance, React encourages composition as a more straightforward and powerful way to build components.

Benefits of composition:

- **Reusability**: Components are more modular and easier to reuse.
- **Maintainability**: Simplifies the codebase by reducing unnecessary props passing.
- **Flexibility**: Allows for more dynamic and flexible UI structures.

---

## Fixing Prop Drilling with Composition

To fix prop drilling, we can restructure our components to use composition. There are several strategies to achieve this:

1. **Lifting State Up**: Move the state to the closest common ancestor.
2. **Using Context API**: Share data without passing props through every level.
3. **Composition via Props**: Pass components as props to achieve more flexible compositions.

For this article, we'll focus on using composition via props.

### Refactoring the Example with Composition

Let's refactor the earlier example using composition.

**Original Structure with Prop Drilling:**

```jsx
function App() {
  const user = { name: 'Alice', age: 30 };

  return <Parent user={user} />;
}

function Parent({ user }) {
  return <Child user={user} />;
}

function Child({ user }) {
  return <GrandChild user={user} />;
}

function GrandChild({ user }) {
  return <div>{user.name}</div>;
}
```

**Refactored Structure Using Composition:**

```jsx
function App() {
  const user = { name: 'Alice', age: 30 };

  return (
    <Parent>
      <Child>
        <GrandChild user={user} />
      </Child>
    </Parent>
  );
}

function Parent({ children }) {
  return <div>{children}</div>;
}

function Child({ children }) {
  return <section>{children}</section>;
}

function GrandChild({ user }) {
  return <div>{user.name}</div>;
}
```

In this refactored version:

- We pass `user` directly to `GrandChild` where it's needed.
- `Parent` and `Child` components now accept `children` props, making them more generic and reusable.
- This eliminates the need for `Parent` and `Child` to handle the `user` prop they don't use.

---

## Building a Layout with Composition

Let's apply composition to build a layout for a web application. We'll create a `Layout` component that composes other components like `Header`, `Content`, and `Footer`.

### Step 1: Define the Layout Components

**Layout.js**

```jsx
function Layout({ header, content, footer }) {
  return (
    <div className="layout">
      {header}
      {content}
      {footer}
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Header.js**

```jsx
function Header() {
  return <header>Header Section</header>;
}
```

**Content.js**

```jsx
function Content({ children }) {
  return <main>{children}</main>;
}
```

**Footer.js**

```jsx
function Footer() {
  return <footer>Footer Section</footer>;
}
```

### Step 2: Compose the Layout in the App Component

**App.js**

```jsx
function App() {
  const user = { name: 'Alice', age: 30 };

  return (
    <Layout
      header={<Header />}
      content={
        <Content>
          <UserProfile user={user} />
        </Content>
      }
      footer={<Footer />}
    />
  );
}
```

**UserProfile.js**

```jsx
function UserProfile({ user }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>User Profile</h2>
      <p>Name: {user.name}</p>
      <p>Age: {user.age}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Explanation

- The `Layout` component accepts `header`, `content`, and `footer` as props, each expected to be a React element.
- This approach allows you to compose the layout by injecting components where they belong without prop drilling.
- The `Content` component accepts `children`, making it flexible to render any content passed to it.
- The `UserProfile` component receives the `user` prop directly from `App`, where the data originates.

### Benefits of This Approach

- **Decoupling Components**: Each component is independent and doesn't need to know about the others' internal workings.
- **Reusability**: Components like `Header`, `Footer`, and `Layout` can be reused across different pages.
- **Flexibility**: You can easily change the composition by swapping out components or rearranging them without modifying the `Layout` component itself.

---

## Advanced Composition Techniques

### Using Render Props

Render props is a technique for sharing code between components using a prop whose value is a function.

**DataProvider.js**

```jsx
function DataProvider({ render }) {
  const data = { name: 'Alice', age: 30 };

  return render(data);
}
```

**App.js**

```jsx
function App() {
  return (
    <DataProvider
      render={(data) => (
        <Layout
          header={<Header />}
          content={
            <Content>
              <UserProfile user={data} />
            </Content>
          }
          footer={<Footer />}
        />
      )}
    />
  );
}
```

In this example, `DataProvider` provides data to its children via a render prop, avoiding prop drilling and keeping components clean.

### Using Higher-Order Components (HOC)

An HOC is a function that takes a component and returns a new component.

**withUser.js**

```jsx
function withUser(Component) {
  return function WrappedComponent(props) {
    const user = { name: 'Alice', age: 30 };
    return <Component {...props} user={user} />;
  };
}
```

**UserProfile.js**

```jsx
function UserProfile({ user }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>User Profile</h2>
      <p>Name: {user.name}</p>
      <p>Age: {user.age}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default withUser(UserProfile);
```

In this scenario, `UserProfile` is wrapped with `withUser`, injecting the `user` prop without prop drilling.

---

## When to Use Context API

While composition is powerful, there are cases where the Context API is more appropriate, especially when:

- **Deeply Nested Data**: When data needs to be accessible by many components at different nesting levels.
- **Theming**: Sharing theme data like colors and fonts.
- **Localization**: Providing localized strings throughout the app.

However, overusing context can make components less reusable and harder to test. It's essential to balance between composition and context based on your application's needs.

---

## Conclusion

Prop drilling can lead to bloated and less maintainable code. By leveraging composition in React, you can create more flexible and reusable components while avoiding the pitfalls of prop drilling. Composition allows you to:

- Pass components as props to build complex UIs.
- Use children props to render nested components.
- Enhance components with additional data or functionality without modifying them directly.

By thoughtfully applying composition patterns, you can build scalable and maintainable React applications that are easier to read and extend.

## Introduction

In this response, we'll delve deeply into the provided React code, explaining each part and how it relates to fixing prop drilling with composition while building a layout. We'll explore how the code utilizes composition to manage state and props effectively, avoiding unnecessary prop drilling. We'll also provide examples and explanations to ensure a thorough understanding.

---

## Overview of the Code

The provided code is a React application that:

- Imports several components like `NavBar`, `Main`, `SearchBar`, `NumResults`, `Box`, `MovieList`, `WatchSummery`, and `WatchedMovieList`.
- Defines two types, `TTempMovieData` and `TTempWatchedData`, which represent the shape of movie data and watched movie data, respectively.
- Initializes some temporary movie data (`tempMovieData`) and watched data (`tempWatchedData`).
- Defines the main `App` component, which uses React's `useState` hook to manage the state of `movies` and `watched`.
- Composes the application layout by nesting components and passing data where necessary.

---

## Detailed Explanation

### Type Definitions

#### `TTempMovieData`

```typescript
export type TTempMovieData = {
  imdbID: string;
  Title: string;
  Year: string;
  Poster: string;
};
```

- This type defines the structure of a movie object in the temporary movie data.
- Properties:
  - `imdbID`: Unique identifier for the movie.
  - `Title`: Title of the movie.
  - `Year`: Release year.
  - `Poster`: URL to the movie poster image.

#### `TTempWatchedData`

```typescript
export type TTempWatchedData = {
  imdbID: string;
  Title: string;
  Year: string;
  Poster: string;
  runtime: number;
  imdbRating: number;
  userRating: number;
};
```

- This type extends `TTempMovieData` by adding additional properties relevant to watched movies.
- Additional Properties:
  - `runtime`: Duration of the movie in minutes.
  - `imdbRating`: IMDb rating of the movie.
  - `userRating`: Rating given by the user.

### Temporary Data Initialization

#### `tempMovieData`

```typescript
const tempMovieData: TTempMovieData[] = [
  {
    imdbID: "tt1375666",
    Title: "Inception",
    Year: "2010",
    Poster: "https://.../Inception.jpg",
  },
  // ...other movies
];
```

- An array of movies conforming to `TTempMovieData`.
- Used to simulate fetched movie data.

#### `tempWatchedData`

```typescript
export const tempWatchedData: TTempWatchedData[] = [
  {
    imdbID: "tt1375666",
    Title: "Inception",
    Year: "2010",
    Poster: "https://.../Inception.jpg",
    runtime: 148,
    imdbRating: 8.8,
    userRating: 10,
  },
  // ...other watched movies
];
```

- An array of watched movies conforming to `TTempWatchedData`.
- Used to simulate user's watched movie list.

### The `App` Component

#### Importing Dependencies

```javascript
import { useState } from "react";
```

- Imports the `useState` hook from React for state management.

#### State Initialization

```javascript
const [movies, setMovies] = useState<TTempMovieData[]>(tempMovieData);
const [watched, setWatched] = useState<TTempWatchedData[]>(tempWatchedData);
```

- Initializes two state variables:
  - `movies`: Holds the list of movies to display.
  - `watched`: Holds the list of movies the user has watched.

#### Return Statement

```jsx
return (
  <>
    <NavBar>
      <SearchBar />
      <NumResults movies={movies} />
    </NavBar>
    <Main>
      <Box>
        <MovieList movies={movies} />
      </Box>
      <Box>
        <WatchSummery watched={watched} />
        <WatchedMovieList watched={watched} />
      </Box>
    </Main>
  </>
);
```

- The `App` component returns a JSX fragment that composes the application's layout.
- Uses composition by nesting components and passing props directly where needed.

---

## Understanding Composition in This Code

### `NavBar` Component

```jsx
<NavBar>
  <SearchBar />
  <NumResults movies={movies} />
</NavBar>
```

- The `NavBar` component composes `SearchBar` and `NumResults` as its children.
- **Composition Advantage**:
  - `NavBar` doesn't need to know about `movies`; it simply renders its children.
  - `NumResults` receives `movies` directly from `App`, avoiding prop drilling through `NavBar`.

### `Main` Component

```jsx
<Main>
  <Box>
    <MovieList movies={movies} />
  </Box>
  <Box>
    <WatchSummery watched={watched} />
    <WatchedMovieList watched={watched} />
  </Box>
</Main>
```

- The `Main` component composes two `Box` components as its children.
- Each `Box` contains components that receive the necessary props directly.
- **Composition Advantage**:
  - `Main` and `Box` components remain generic and reusable.
  - Data (`movies` and `watched`) is passed directly to components that need it, like `MovieList` and `WatchSummery`.

---

## Avoiding Prop Drilling

In traditional prop drilling, we might have passed `movies` and `watched` down through multiple components that don't need them. For example:

```jsx
function App() {
  // state variables
  return (
    <NavBar movies={movies}>
      <SearchBar />
      <NumResults />
    </NavBar>
    // ...
  );
}

function NavBar({ movies, children }) {
  return (
    <nav>
      {children}
      {/* NavBar doesn't use movies but passes it down */}
    </nav>
  );
}

function NumResults({ movies }) {
  return <div>{movies.length} Results</div>;
}
```

- Here, `NavBar` receives `movies` only to pass it to `NumResults`.
- This leads to unnecessary coupling and cluttered code.

**In the provided code**, by using composition:

- `App` passes `movies` directly to `NumResults`.
- `NavBar` remains unaware of `movies`, keeping it clean and reusable.

---

## Detailed Breakdown of Components

### `NavBar` Component

Assuming `NavBar` is defined as:

```jsx
function NavBar({ children }) {
  return <nav>{children}</nav>;
}
```

- **Purpose**: Provides a container for navigation-related components.
- **Composition**: Accepts `children`, allowing any components to be nested inside.
- **Benefit**: Makes `NavBar` flexible and reusable in different contexts.

### `SearchBar` Component

```jsx
function SearchBar() {
  // ...component logic
  return <input type="text" placeholder="Search movies..." />;
}
```

- **Purpose**: Allows users to search for movies.
- **Props**: None in this context, but could be extended to handle search input.

### `NumResults` Component

```jsx
function NumResults({ movies }) {
  return <div>{movies.length} movies found</div>;
}
```

- **Purpose**: Displays the number of movies found.
- **Props**:
  - `movies`: The array of movies to count.
- **Data Flow**:
  - Receives `movies` directly from `App`, avoiding prop drilling through `NavBar`.

### `Main` Component

```jsx
function Main({ children }) {
  return <main>{children}</main>;
}
```

- **Purpose**: Acts as the main content area of the application.
- **Composition**: Uses `children` to render nested components.
- **Benefit**: Keeps `Main` generic and focused on layout rather than data.

### `Box` Component

```jsx
function Box({ children }) {
  return <div className="box">{children}</div>;
}
```

- **Purpose**: Provides a styled container for grouping components.
- **Composition**: Accepts `children`, enabling flexible content inside.
- **Benefit**: Enhances reusability and separation of concerns.

### `MovieList` Component

```jsx
function MovieList({ movies }) {
  return (
    <ul>
      {movies.map((movie) => (
        <li key={movie.imdbID}>{movie.Title}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

- **Purpose**: Displays a list of movies.
- **Props**:
  - `movies`: Array of movie objects to display.
- **Data Flow**:
  - Receives `movies` directly from `App`, ensuring it has the data it needs without intermediary components.

### `WatchSummery` Component

```jsx
function WatchSummery({ watched }) {
  const totalMovies = watched.length;
  const averageRating =
    watched.reduce((sum, movie) => sum + movie.userRating, 0) / totalMovies;

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Total Movies Watched: {totalMovies}</p>
      <p>Average Rating: {averageRating.toFixed(1)}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

- **Purpose**: Summarizes the watched movies.
- **Props**:
  - `watched`: Array of watched movie objects.
- **Data Calculations**:
  - Calculates total movies watched.
  - Computes the average user rating.

### `WatchedMovieList` Component

```jsx
function WatchedMovieList({ watched }) {
  return (
    <ul>
      {watched.map((movie) => (
        <li key={movie.imdbID}>
          {movie.Title} - Rating: {movie.userRating}
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

- **Purpose**: Displays a list of watched movies with user ratings.
- **Props**:
  - `watched`: Array of watched movie objects.
- **Data Flow**:
  - Receives `watched` directly from `App`.

---

## Benefits of This Approach

### Enhanced Readability

- By passing data directly to the components that need it, the code becomes easier to read and understand.
- Developers can see where data originates and where it is used without tracing through multiple components.

### Improved Maintainability

- Components are decoupled and have a single responsibility.
- Changes in one component have minimal impact on others.

### Increased Reusability

- Components like `NavBar`, `Main`, and `Box` are generic and can be reused in different parts of the application or in other projects.

### Avoidance of Prop Drilling

- Data is not unnecessarily passed through components that don't need it.
- This reduces the complexity and potential for bugs.

---

## Applying the Concepts: An Example Scenario

### Scenario

Suppose we want to add a feature that allows users to add a movie to their watched list directly from the `MovieList` component.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Update `MovieList` Component**

   - Add a button to each movie item to handle adding to the watched list.
   - Since `MovieList` needs to update the `watched` state, we'll need to pass a handler function.

   ```jsx
   function MovieList({ movies, onAddToWatched }) {
     return (
       <ul>
         {movies.map((movie) => (
           <li key={movie.imdbID}>
             {movie.Title}
             <button onClick={() => onAddToWatched(movie)}>Watch</button>
           </li>
         ))}
       </ul>
     );
   }
   ```

2. **Pass Handler from `App` to `MovieList`**

   - Define the `handleAddToWatched` function in `App`.
   - Pass it to `MovieList`.

   ```jsx
   export default function App() {
     // ...state variables

     const handleAddToWatched = (movie) => {
       setWatched([...watched, { ...movie, userRating: 0 }]);
     };

     return (
       // ...
       <Main>
         <Box>
           <MovieList movies={movies} onAddToWatched={handleAddToWatched} />
         </Box>
         // ...
       </Main>
     );
   }
   ```

3. **Update Components Accordingly**

   - Now, `MovieList` can add movies to the watched list without prop drilling.
   - `MovieList` remains focused on its role and only receives the necessary props.

### Composition Benefits in This Scenario

- **Direct Data Flow**: `handleAddToWatched` is defined where the `watched` state exists (`App`) and passed directly to `MovieList`.
- **No Prop Drilling**: Intermediate components like `Box` and `Main` are not involved in passing `handleAddToWatched`.
- **Maintainability**: Easy to track where state updates occur, simplifying debugging and future enhancements.

---

## Further Enhancements with Context API

While composition solves many issues with prop drilling, there are cases where the Context API is beneficial.

### When to Use Context

- **Global State**: When certain data needs to be accessible by many components at various levels.
- **Theming and Localization**: Sharing themes or language settings.

### Implementing Context in This App

Suppose the user's authentication status needs to be accessed by multiple components.

1. **Create Context**

   ```jsx
   import { createContext } from "react";

   export const UserContext = createContext(null);
   ```

2. **Provide Context in `App`**

   ```jsx
   export default function App() {
     const user = { name: "John Doe", isLoggedIn: true };

     return (
       <UserContext.Provider value={user}>
         {/* ...rest of the app */}
       </UserContext.Provider>
     );
   }
   ```

3. **Consume Context in a Component**

   ```jsx
   import { useContext } from "react";
   import { UserContext } from "./UserContext";

   function NavBar({ children }) {
     const user = useContext(UserContext);

     return (
       <nav>
         <span>Welcome, {user.name}</span>
         {children}
       </nav>
     );
   }
   ```

- **Benefit**: Components like `NavBar` can access `user` data without prop drilling or altering the composition structure.

---

## Conclusion

The provided code exemplifies how to effectively use composition to build a React application while avoiding prop drilling. By:

- **Passing props directly** to components that need them.
- **Using composition** to nest components and build the layout.
- **Keeping components generic** and reusable by utilizing `children` and composition patterns.

This approach leads to cleaner, more maintainable code that is easier to read and extend.

---

## Key Takeaways

- **Composition over Prop Drilling**: Structure your components to pass data directly where needed.
- **Generic Components**: Use `children` props to create flexible and reusable components.
- **State Management**: Keep state close to where it's relevant and pass handler functions as needed.
- **Avoid Unnecessary Coupling**: Don't pass props through components that don't use them.

## Additional Examples

### Example 1: Extending `NavBar` with User Info

Suppose we want `NavBar` to display the number of watched movies.

#### Update `NavBar` Component

```jsx
function NavBar({ children, watchedCount }) {
  return (
    <nav>
      {children}
      <div>Watched Movies: {watchedCount}</div>
    </nav>
  );
}
```

#### Pass `watchedCount` from `App`

```jsx
<NavBar watchedCount={watched.length}>
  <SearchBar />
  <NumResults movies={movies} />
</NavBar>
```

- **Direct Prop Passing**: `App` passes `watched.length` directly to `NavBar`.
- **No Prop Drilling**: Intermediate components are not involved.

### Example 2: Adding a Theme Context

#### Create Theme Context

```jsx
export const ThemeContext = createContext("light");
```

#### Provide Theme in `App`

```jsx
export default function App() {
  return (
    <ThemeContext.Provider value="dark">
      {/* ...rest of the app */}
    </ThemeContext.Provider>
  );
}
```

#### Consume Theme in Components

```jsx
function Box({ children }) {
  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);
  return <div className={`box ${theme}`}>{children}</div>;
}
```

- **Benefit**: All `Box` components can adapt to the theme without prop drilling.

---

## Final Thoughts

By embracing composition and thoughtful state management, you can create React applications that are both scalable and easy to maintain. Remember to:

- **Identify the minimal necessary data** each component needs.
- **Pass data directly** to those components.
- **Use composition** to build your UI, nesting components as needed.
- **Leverage context wisely** for truly global data, but avoid overusing it to prevent unnecessary complexity.
